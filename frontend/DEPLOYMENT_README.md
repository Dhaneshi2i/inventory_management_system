# Frontend Deployment Guide

## Build Status ✅
The frontend application has been successfully built and is ready for deployment to Vercel.

## Build Output
- **Main Bundle**: `dist/assets/index-DPZ0MUfn.js` (587KB, gzipped: 170KB)
- **CSS Bundle**: `dist/assets/index-CYYlFRM4.css` (43KB, gzipped: 7KB)
- **HTML Entry**: `dist/index.html` (683B)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy to Vercel
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. Vercel will automatically detect the Vite configuration
4. The build will use the settings in `vercel.json`

### 2. Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file in the frontend directory with:
```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/v1
VITE_APP_NAME=Inventory Management System
```

For Vercel deployment, set these environment variables:
- `VITE_API_BASE_URL`: Your backend API URL (e.g., https://your-backend.vercel.app/api/v1)
- `VITE_APP_NAME`: Application name (optional)
